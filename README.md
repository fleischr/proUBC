# provide-abap

Open-source implementation of the PRVD Stack baseline middleware pattern for SAP, using ABAP

## About provide-abap
provide-abap enables SAP systems to:
- Access Web3 and other blockchain based services from the likes of Ethereum, Polygon, Celo, Chainlink, VeChain, Filecoin, Bitcoin, PRVD Layer 3 and many others
- Integrate *composable* zero-knowledge workflows to ensure privacy and optimized cross-company collaboration across a variety of business use cases in finance, supply chain, CRM, manufacturing, sustainability and more.

[Provide Shuttle](https://shuttle.provide.services) complements provide-abap as an easy to use, low code designer to onboard your SAP S/4 HANA system to the business transformation use cases made possible with zero knowledge cryptography and Web3 services. We also highly recommend you to download the [PRVD CLI](https://github.com/provideplatform/provide-cli) to augment your development and administration activities implementing provide-abap and the PRVD stack.

Learn more about provide-abap and how to install and configure it in your SAP system at our docs site [here](https://docs.provide.services/proubc)

## SAP BTP and cloud platforms

Additional modifications to support use of provide-abap in the ABAP Cloud Steampunk environment is planned in the near future. 

Feel free to check out [provide-js](https://github.com/provideplatform/provide-js) for TypeScript / Javascript / Node.js apps on SAP BTP. Several other similar SDKs are available to support your projects in Rust, Golang, .NET, Python, PHP and many others.
